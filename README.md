Project Name: Bowdoin Sampling Maschine
Description: Hypnotic, dreamy, and chill songs that allow
you to dance, study, and relax to! First song is more upbeat
and had more of a happier feel. Second song utilizes a sample
I found on looperman.com and slices + chooses slices randomly.
Third song is my attempt at creating a more melodic, deep house
song. Enjoy!
